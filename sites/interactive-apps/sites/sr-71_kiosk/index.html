        <h1>Cockpits</h1>

        <div class="info">

            <h2>Seats:</h2>

            <ul>

                <li>The SR-71 features two cockpits with one seat each</li>

                <li>The front cockpit was used for the pilot and the rear cockpit was used for the navigator</li>

                <li>On training models, the rear cockpit was raised. This would be where the instructor would be located</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Life Support:</h2>

            <ul>
                
                <li>Specialized protective, pressurized suits, similar to suits worn by astronauts, due to high altitudes</li>

                <li>Onboard oxygen supply to keep the suit pressurized during the descent in cases of an emergency ejection</li>

                <li>Food and drink provided during long reconaissance flights and was guided into an opening in the helmet</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sensors:</h2>

            <ul>
                
                <li>Optical/Infrared Imagery</li>

                <li>Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR)</li>

        <h1>Airframe</h1>

        <div class="info">

            <h2>Material:</h2>

            <ul>

                <li>Use of titanium was limited to components exposed to the highest temperatures, due to cost</li>

                <li>Titanium was used for 85% of the structure. The rest was made using polymer composite materials</li>

                <li>Major sections of the skin of the inboard wings were corrugated, not smooth. This allowed them to expand horizontally and vertically at high temperatures, increasing longitudinal strength</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Shape:</h2>

            <ul>
                
                <li>The SR-71 was used for long, stealthy, reconaissance missions and needed to be able to fly undetected</li>

                <li>The SR-71 features flattened, tapering sides that reflect most energy away from a radar beam's place of origin</li>

                <li>Special radar-absorbing materials were incorporated into sawtooth-shaped sections of the aircraft's skin</li>

            </ul>

    <div class="info-panel" id="engine-info">

        <h1>Engines</h1>

        <div class="info">

            <h2>Specs:</h2>

            <ul>

                <li>The SR-71 was powered by two Pratt & Whitney J58 axial-flow turbojet engines</li>

                <li>The Blackbird could reach speeds over Mach 3 and the fastest reported speed was 2,193 mph</li>

                <li>Maximum flight speed was limited by the temperature of the air entering the engine compressor, which was not certified for temperatures above 800&deg;F</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Air Inlets:</h2>

            <ul>
                
                <li>The air inlets allowed the SR-71 to cruise at over Mach 3.2, with the air slowing down to subsonic speed as it entered the engine</li>

                <li>Mach 3.2 was the design point for the aircraft, its most efficient speed, however, in practice it was sometimes more efficient at even higher speeds</li>

            </ul>
